Game now runs

## Known Issues
1) Main menu buttons hit detection is wrong. 

2) Game running state isn't working. Likely a spawn location error given the issues with positioning on the main menu. 

3) Sound isn't working and powerups are missing. I will need to go through the submission files to find them.
